- Educate users about their rights, legal duties, and civic procedures.
- Simplify complex government policies into accessible information.
- Provide state-wise guidance on reporting civic issues like waste, water, and corruption.
- Encourage participation in public campaigns and local governance initiatives.
- Enable real-time civic support using multilingual AI models.

## üéØ SDG Alignment
CIVICA contributes to:
- **Sustainable Cities and Communities**
- **Climate Action**
- **Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions**

```

- **Civic Sources**: Curated legal, policy, and governance datasets.
- **Data Pipeline**: Cleans, tokenizes, and indexes data into vector space.
- **Vector Store**: Stores state-wise documents for semantic search (FAISS, ChromaDB).
- **RAG LLM**: Watsonx-powered Retrieval-Augmented Generation using civic vectors.
- **Agent UI**: User interface to query, receive answers, and give feedback.

## üöÄ Deployment

**Tech Stack:**
- IBM Watsonx.ai for LLM grounded with the vector document for  (RAG functionality)
- Python backend (Flask-like using `app.py`)
- Static HTML/JS frontend served via `http.server`
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD

**Deployment Options:**
- IBM Cloud
- Local deployment using Python HTTP and app server
- REST API-based communication
